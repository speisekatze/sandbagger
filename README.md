**Aggregates Blocklists from different sources into categories**

This app spawns a simple HTTP(S) server on a given port. It serves DNSBL-files in multiple categories to feed pfBlockerNG. The server removes duplicate hosts from different sources for each category. The categories and sources are fully customizable.

## Sources used

I'm using various sources for this project. At first, I used blocklists of Stephen Black's ["hosts" project](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/) as initial lists. But decided to take his sources and scrape his update-files for more granular blocklists and his *extensions* as category names.
Here is a list of all sources currently used in the sandbagger configuration. Feel free to add your sources of blocklists.
